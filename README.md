Document Chains, is (or will be) an easy to use scaleable electronical signed Document Management System

Document Chains manages all your Static documents, like birth certificates and bills. 
It can be uses much like GIT on a stand alone. 

It attaches documens together so they can build chains. For example: Latex results in dvi -> ps -> pdf or an RFC822 message has an attachment which is a signed pdf which contains a bill of some sort which results in a Book record. 

All this is searchable.

You can copy together two different storage pools and continue working. 

You can sign every message tag and every property. 

You can also do automatic OCR and perform tasks on various uploads.
